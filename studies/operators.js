/**
 * OPERATORS:
 * 0. Operators 
 * 
 * Order of operations or Operator precedence determines the oder in which operators
 * are evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Assignment Operator
 * Assignment operatorUsed to initialize variables.
 * 
 * =
 * 
 * +=
 * -
 * -=
 * 
 * 2. Arithmetic Operators
 * 
 * +
 * -
 * *
 * /
 * %
 * **
 * +=
 * -=
 * *=
 * /=
 * 
 * 3. Comparison Operators
 * 
 * Return a boolean value when the expression is evaluated. 
 * 
 * <
 * >
 * <=
 * >=
 * ==
 * ===
 * !=
 * !==
 *
 * 
 * 4. Logical Operators
 * These evaluate to a boolean.
 * 
 * &&: and. returns true if and only if BOTH of the operands are ture.
 * ||: or. returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
 * !
 * 
 * 5. Unary Operators (!, typeOf, -)
 * This operator takes only one operand.
 * 
 * typeof: returns a string of that value's type.
 * ! : called the bang operator. Negates the value of a boolean expression.
 * - :
 * ++ :
 * __ :
 * 
 * 6. Binary operator
 * This operator takes two operands. Comparison and arithmetic operators are binary.
 * 
 * 7. Ternary Operator (a ? b:c)
 * Sometimes the conditional operator. This operator takes three operands. 
 *
 * 8. String operators
 * + is used to concatenate strings. This takes two string values as its 
 * operands and returns a new string of their combination. 
 * += can also be used on strings to accomplish the same thing. 
 * =
